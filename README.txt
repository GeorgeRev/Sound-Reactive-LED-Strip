# Sound-Reactive-LED-Strip

A simple Arduino Nano system, which utilises a KY-038 microphone module and a WS2312B LED strip.

The microphone should be calibrated using the potensiometer. To adjust make a constant sound and gradually turn pot up or down until the digital output starts or stops being triggered.
